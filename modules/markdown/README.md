# Markdown module

This module enables you to use [Markdown](https://commonmark.org/help/) in Noodl. It's implemented with [react-markdown](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown) which in turn uses [remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark).

Read the [guide](/modules/markdown/markdown-guide.md) to get started.
