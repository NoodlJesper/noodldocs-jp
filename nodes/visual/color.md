# COLOR
Contains a color. This can be used to store a color and reuse it in multiple places.

<div class = "node-inputs">

## INPUTS
**Value**  
The value to store in the node. The output value will equal this value, unless *Save value*
is connected and is set to false (see below).

**Save value**  
This is used to only update the output when *Save Value* is set to true. This will allow you to freeze
the stored value and only allow it to update under certain conditions, e.g. on a Tap.

</div>

<div class = "node-outputs">

## OUTPUTS
**Saved value**  
The color stored in the node
