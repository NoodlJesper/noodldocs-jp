# BOOLEAN
Contains a boolean (true/false). This can be used to quickly store a boolean without having to use a Javascript node.

<div class = "node-inputs">

## INPUTS
**Value**  
The value to store in the node. The output value will equal this value, unless *Save value* is connected and is set to false (see below).

**Save value**
This is used to only update the output when *Save Value* is set to true. This will allow you to freeze the stored value and only allow it to update under certain conditions, e.g. on a Tap.

</div>

<div class = "node-outputs">

## OUTPUTS
**Saved value**  
The boolean stored in the node

</div>
